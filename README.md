# Java-Android-Game-Final-Project
## Project Description
For this project we had freedom to make any game for Android with Java as long as it had:
- Multiple Enemies.
- 3 Levels.
- A Level editor.
- Score.

For this project I decided to make a Pac-man style game.

## Game Features
The following features have been achived in this project:
- Controllable character Pac-man.
- 4 Enemies in a stage, each with different biases.
- A stage based on the original Pac-man.
- A stage with inspiration from Pac-man CE DX+.
- A stage with a boss (snake which has slightly different characteristics).
- A Level editor (the wall sprites automatically adjust to the wall shape).
- Other menu pages such as settings, how to play, about and player highscores.
- Player score which increase for every Pacdot and power pellet. Decreases for every life lost.
- Background music (taken from Pac-man CE DX+ and Pac-man CE 2)
- Sound effects (taken from Pac-man)

## Android Requirements
Needs Android 5.0+ to run (and Android 8.0+ to have custom fonts). Compiled using Android Studio.

[The Pac-man Dossier from Gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3938/the_pacman_dossier.php?print=1) explains some indepth behaviours of Pac-man and the ghosts and how the game is created and was a huge help for the creation of this project. Although this project doesn't go into this much level of detail, they are similar and more simpler.
